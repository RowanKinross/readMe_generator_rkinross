# ReadMe Generator

## Project status
Development for this project is on pause, for now.

## Description
ReadMe Generator is a tool that takes the input from a user and uses it to generate a readMe file. The aim of the project was to make a tool which could aid a user to write a readme faster whilst limiting the chance of crucial elements being missed from the readme. Therefore saving the user time and energy to spend on the main project, but still encouraging a user to have proper documentation. Users can use their time more efficiently, hopefully enabling an even better project outcome. The project makes use of node.js, inquiry and JavaScript. <br>

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
Upon opening the project, the user is taken to the folder containing documentation, script and an output folder. The user then has to open the integrated terminal and run the command "node index.js" in order to begin the sequence of questions they need to answer for the readme to be generated. Upon completion, a new readme file is generated and can be found in the output folder. This file can either be copied or the text can be copied for use in the repo of the project that the user has in mind.
